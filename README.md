This project presents a peer-to-peer payment system that uses MetaMask, Truffle, and Ganache CLI to set up a local blockchain network. The system also has a user-friendly front-end developed with ReactJS, and the smart contracts are coded in Solidity. Users can sign in to MetaMask and transfer any currency they want. The system will then convert the currency to its cryptocurrency equivalent and send it to the receiver. The changes are reflected in the blockchain system, and the payment is recorded on the blockchain.
