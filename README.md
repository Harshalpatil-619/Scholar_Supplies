# Scholar- Supplies
# Blockchain Powered Student Support for Essential Resources Charity Platform .
This project presents a Donor to student(need fund for resources) payment system that uses MetaMask, Truffle, and Ganache CLI to set up a local blockchain network. The system also has a user-friendly front-end developed with ReactJS, and the smart contracts are coded in Solidity. Users can sign in to MetaMask and transfer any currency they want. The system will then convert the currency to its cryptocurrency equivalent and send it to the receiver. The changes are reflected in the blockchain system, and the payment is recorded on the blockchain.


In smartContract->
truffle compile
truffle migrate

In client->
npm install @vitejs/plugin-react --save-dev
